# A Giant's Life
### A Game Boy Development Exercise

This was made for [Ludum Dare 38 Compo](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38) in just 48 hours. It was intended to be a game, but there's no gameplay actually! I just added more and more features and... that's all. Everything compiles at least!

I want to rethink all this and make a game out of it. I have to think about gameplay, assets, sprite interaction, music, sound effects, etc. 48 hours have not been enough for a C newbie like me :)

[ZGB](https://github.com/Zal0/ZGB) and its basic template were used, with many code snippets taken directly from [Super Princess 2097 EXODUS](https://github.com/Zal0/gbjam2016) (jump and lots of other ideas).

Code is really messy, so please don't take it as an example for anything.
